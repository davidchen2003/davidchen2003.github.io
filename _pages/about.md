Greetings! My name is Jingyang Chen(陈 敬旸), and I am currently a junior student at the College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University. After graduation in 2025, I plan to pursue for a Ph.D degree.

My research interest lies in theoretical and computational chemistry and biophysics, specifically in multiscale modeling of biomolecular. I am also interested in spectroscopic and imaging techniques. 

My research experience includes simulations of allosteric protein, which aimed to reveal that long-range coupled mechanical responses are easy to achieve in disordered networks in a computationally efficient approach by using perturbation-theory analysis.

Greetings! I am Jingyang Chen(陈 敬旸), a junior student currently at College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University. My research focuses on theoretical and computational biophysical chemistry, especially far-from-equilibrium biochemical phenomena. Additionally, I have a keen interest in exploring the intersection of these disciplines with machine learning. I plan to pursue for a Ph.D degree after graduation in 2025.

I am fascinated about soccer. I will share my insights on games, players and rules in the "blogs" section, looking forward to your browsing!

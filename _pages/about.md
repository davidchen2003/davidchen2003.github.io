Greetings! I am Jingyang Chen(陈 敬旸), a junior student currently at the College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University. My research focuses on theoretical and computational chemistry and biophysics. I am also interested in spectroscopic and imaging techniques. I plan to pursue for a Ph.D degree after graduation in 2025.

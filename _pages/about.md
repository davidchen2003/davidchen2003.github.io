Hi, my name is Jingyang Chen, in simplified chinese, 陈敬旸. I am a junior student currently at Peking University. I study chemistry @ College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering and physics @ School of Physics. My research interests lie in theoretical and computational biophysical chemistry, especially far-from-equilibrium biochemical phenomena. Additionally, I have a keen interest in exploring the intersection of these disciplines with machine learning. I plan to pursue for a Ph.D degree after graduation in 2025.

My hobbies
======
I am fascinated about soccer, enjoy playing badminton, and have been cultivating my habits of fitness in gym lately. I finished fourth in the Freshmen Football Cup of PKU(2021) and scored a hat-trick on debut. My favorite players are Arjen Robben and Dennis Bergkamp. I also have a passion for Jin Yong's martial arts novels.

Hi, my name is Jingyang Chen, in simplified chinese, 陈敬旸. I am a junior student currently at Peking University. I study chemistry @ College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering and physcis @ School of Physics. My research interests lie in theoretical and computational biophysical chemistry, especially biochemical systems out of equilibrium. I'm also willing to learn about machine learning. I plan to pursue for a Ph.D degree after graduation in 2025.

My hobbies
======
I am fascinated about soccer, enjoy playing badminton, and have been cultivating my habits of fitness in gym lately. I finished fourth in the Freshmen Football Cup of PKU(2021) and scored a hat-trick on debut. My favorite players are Arjen Robben and Dennis Bergkamp. My another hobby is strategy games, such as Football Manager and Civilization IV.
